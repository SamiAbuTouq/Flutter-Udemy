## Projects I did through this course:

### Quiz App:
The Quiz App which allows you to start a quiz, then navigate various Flutter-related questions where the possible answers are actually displayed in random order, and once you went through all questions, you get a summary screen to where you can see which questions were answered correctly and which ones were answered incorrectly, and you can of course also restart the quiz if you want to.
